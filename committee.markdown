### *President*, <a href="mailto:president@exetermcr.org">Challenger Mishra</a>
Dear current and future Exonians,

I am your MCR President, Challenger. I hail from the beautiful and
mysterious land of India. I am pursuing a DPhil in Theoretical Physics
and currently in my second year.

The Exeter MCR is a vibrant community of people from diverse social and
academic backgrounds. It is also one of the closest knit and larger
graduate communities in Oxford. Our social agenda includes exchanges with
other colleges in and outside Oxford, BOPs, Friday Tea and Cakes, Exeter
House socials, Pub Crawls and plenty more. The MCR also provides welfare
support to its members. It is one of the most exciting communities to be
a part of whether you are an intellectual or a social creature. With the
700th Anniversary just around the corner, these are exciting times to be
an Exonian.

Always available to listen to your ideas and concerns. Feel free to drop
in an email or have a chat.

### *Treasurer-Elect*, <a href="mailto:treasurers@exetermcr.org">Francisca Gale</a>

My name's Francisca (like Francisco with an 'a' at the end, funnily
enough, or Fran) and I'm from the Isle of Man, but I promise I won't
siphon the MCR's funds into a trust or company based there. In a
previous academic life, I studied German and Modern Greek at King's
College London, whence I came to Exeter/Oxford in 2010 to specialise in
medieval German literature.  I'm now writing a doctoral thesis on the
poetics of adaptation as evidenced by various twelfth- and
thirteenth-century narrative texts.  I can usually be found sitting in
the MCR in the chair next to the kitchen.

### *Treasurer*, <a href="mailto:treasurers@exetermcr.org">Samuel Denny</a>

Sam is a second-year DPhil student in Physics, and MCR treasurer for the year 2012-2013.  Frequently to be seen around college, Sam will manage the MCR accounts for the next year and ensure that the MCR can provide a supportive and enjoyable community within the limitations of its budget.

### *Welfare Officer*, <a href="mailto:treasurers@exetermcr.org">Esther Kwan</a>

Esther completed a B.A. in Government and a B.Sc. in Urban and Regional
Studies at Cornell University. After her undergraduate degree, she
taught English in the West Bank and interned at an Arab research
center. Between sharing iftarswith her Palestinian host family and
having cups of shai with the locals, she became inspired by grassroots
efforts in shaping the discourse on poverty and development. Her brief
Middle Eastern sojourn inspired her to study and conduct research on
international development at the University of Oxford.

As the MCR’s Welfare Officer, Esther will ensure that your Oxford
experience is fulfilling and satisfying to the utmost degree. Tea and
Cakes sessions (with the possibility of ice cream sundae afternoons,
milkshakes, and wings and calzones nights) will come with the added
benefit of free hugs. Being a perpetual night owl, Esther will make
available a 24/7 hotline for coping with any all-nighters, essay crisis,
and thesis deadlines that you may find yourself in this academic
year. She intends to fulfill her campaign promise, which is to bake for
the entire MCR at least once a term, hopefully satisfying your mid-day
cravings for anything doused in maple syrup or powdered sugar. For those
inclined to occasional spa therapy/pampering sessions, she will make
proposals to amply provide for such indulgences.

### *Social Secretary*, <a href="mailto:social@exetermcr.org">Imogen
Parry</a>
Hi, my name is Imogen and I am delighted to be one of your new social
secretaries!  Andrew, Birgit and Yue-Yi are a hard act to follow but I
promise to try and make our bops as good as theirs, and to provide
plenty of other events to get the whole MCR involved.  Even though I've
been in Oxford for so many years that I'm running out of fingers to
count them on, I'm still finding new things to do here so let's enjoy
them!

### *Social Secretary*, Andreas Harris
Hello! I am the least pretty of the Exeter College MCR's social
secretaries. Our MCR is incredibly tight and has a very enthusiastic active
membership. As a happy, organising events for such a happy crowd is a very
rewarding task. Ultimately, the most pleasant aspect of life at Oxford is
the stimulating environment filled with eclectic characters. The college
system uniquely facilitates encounters and friendships between individuals
studying completely different subjects. I see it as my duty to promote this
mixing, as it was something I personally lacked during my undergraduate,
and ensure our tights knit community continues!

### *IT Officer*, <a href="mailto:it@exetermcr.org">Abhishek Dasgupta</a>
Abhishek is actually an android who is interested in how humans interact with technology, using it to improve their lives and make sense of the world around us. In spare time, Abhishek also takes care of the MCR website and plays table tennis. Previously Abhishek studied physics, but has acknowledged that his nature is better suited to understanding the world using computer science, which Abhishek is happily doing as part of a DPhil.

### *Environmental Rep*, <a href="mailto:environmental@exetermcr.org">Alistair Hanson</a>
Hullo, I'm Alistair, and I've ended up as Environmental Rep, which
means I am to ensure that the plant remains watered and the rubbish
suitably divided. Originally from Cheshire (the non-footballer bit), I
grew up in various parts of England, with differing levels of Richard
Curtis-style idyllism. I previously studied history, and, after a period
working for the Bodleian Library, shall return to doing so. I like
badgers, penguins, dogs, cheese, hoarding things, and complaining about
the tourists. I am often to be found in the MCR, usually asleep. In my
spare time, I solve crimes, with the assistance of pipe tobacco and my
band of Baker Street Irregulars.

### *Library Rep*, <a href="mailto:library@exetermcr.org">Paola Ferrari</a>

Hi there, I am a third year DPhil student in Physical and Theoretical
Chemistry studying Soft Condensed Matter and looking at
Polyphenols-Polymer interaction and phase behavior in emulsions. As many
of you may know I have a little boy named Matteo who times to times show
up in the MCR.  I am the MCR Library rep, which means that I represent
the graduate student body (MCR) at Library Committee Meetings to protect
our interest as College library users.  It is well known that I am a
"low impact" Library user since I am hardly ever there but you can
always feed me in with your Library related issues, just send me an
e-mail..
