<h3>University</h3>

Sport plays an important part in the lives of Oxford students. Superiority over "the other place" is established every year in each sport’s varsity match. Oxford alumni and alumna have participated in the Olympics. 
The various sports on offer represent the perfect way to offset too many hours sitting at a desk. You don’t have to be a world-class athlete to take part in one of the many College or University teams. 
Maybe Oxford is just the place to try out something completely new!
<p></p>
At the University level, we have all kinds of sports, from Archery to Yachting.
In some cases, University level is quite competitive, with trials and daily training. 
In other cases, it is quite casual and open to absolute beginners. 
For more information on the different sports on offer at the University level, check out their presence at the Freshers’ Fair or the respective websites.

<h3>College</h3>

    Sport in Exeter is geared to all levels of ability. 
    Many Exonians compete at the highest level for the College or the University. 
    However, most sports there are opportunities for both men and women at various levels of ability, including complete beginners. 
    As a result, many who disdained sport before find themselves participating enthusiastically at College. 
    The College has excellent sporting facilities, including a high-quality sports ground with football, rugby, hockey and cricket pitches; grass tennis courts; a squash court; and a well-equipped weights room in College.

<hr class="light">
<h3>Exeter College Boat Club (ECBC)</h3>

ECBC is one of the oldest boat clubs in the world and is undergoing a period of renaissance with success to rival the club’s rich history.
The club is very open, social, and welcoming to complete novices and experienced rowers alike. 
Rowing at Exeter is a true pleasure and is enhanced by our very own Exeter College boat house. 
With several men’s and women’s boats competing in all the important races, there is ample opportunity to give rowing a try.
The boat club recruits new rowers in Michaelmas term.

<h3>Football</h3>

    Exeter College Association Football Club, ECAFC, is one of the absolute powerhouses of the beautiful game in Oxford. 
    In the 2013/14 season, the Men’s Football first team won the annual Cuppers competition. 
    The Men’s second team has been unstoppable in recent memory in its meteoric rise through the divisions.
    And, the Women’s team is establishing itself as force to be reckoned with. 
    Despite its many successes and vaunted history, ECAFC is incredibly friendly and always looking for new players of all levels.
    While a majority of players hail from the JCR, MCR members are highly encouraged to join us at our own pitch just off Marston Road.

<hr class="light">
<h3>Rugby</h3>

    Exeter College Rugby Football Club, ECRFC, competes in the intercollegiate league and cup competition. 
    It offers the perfect possibility for playing Rugby Union and representing the College’s colors.
<p></p>
    Besides the three staples of sport in Oxford, the College has its own Netball, Badminton, and Cricket teams that compete in the intercollegiate leagues. 
    For more information, check out the Exeter Freshers’ Fair or contact your friendly Sports Rep.

<hr class="light">
<h3>College and University Gyms</h3>

    Last but not least, we all love to hit the gym every once in a while. 
    There is a small weights room in College, and all members of the MCR take advantage of the heavily subsidised gym and pool facilities at the University Sport Centre.
    The facility has a moderately-sized gym and pool.
